# VRSketchingGeometry
Unity project for the creation of line geometry for VR sketching

## Quick start
1. Instantiate SketchObject.prefab to create a new line.
2. Use methods of attached LineSketchObject component to add and remove control points of the line.

## Sample scene
The creation of the line is controlled in ExtrudeTest.cs.
